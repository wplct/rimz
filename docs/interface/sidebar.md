# The sidebar, on screen

The sidebar is one narrow column that answers a single question: **which pane needs you, right now.** Every pane in the room is a row; agents are enriched from the store; everything groups by the worktree it lives in. The sidebar routes you to the pane — you read and answer in the agent's own UI.

It stacks three reading zones, top to bottom — the **cockpit** (who is here, what it costs, what needs you), the **agent cards** (one card per pane, grouped by worktree), and the **provider dashboard** (your accounts, their budgets, and the optional pet) — with bottom chrome (a footer and a health line) pinned under all three.

This page shows what the sidebar *means on screen*. Three companions own the rest: [theme.md](../guide/theme.md) is the knobs that restyle every tone, glyph, and animation; [internals/sidebar/sidebar.md](../internals/sidebar/sidebar.md) is how the column is built — presence, launch, reload recovery, the view-model; [DESIGN.md → Triage at a glance](../../DESIGN.md#triage-at-a-glance) is why it works this way. Where a behavior or a tone is produced elsewhere, this page names what you see and links the mechanism rather than restating it.

Every frame below is what the renderer actually paints — structure, glyphs, columns, and alignment exact; the live values (ages, percentages, resets, counts) illustrative. Color comes from the active palette, RGB on a truecolor terminal and quantized to xterm 256 colors on an indexed one. These frames are colorless text, so they read as `NO_COLOR` does: shapes carry every meaning, and color only reinforces.

## The whole frame at a glance

A complete frame: a selected agent in a worktree, with the per-provider dashboard pinned at the bottom. The cockpit figures use the current RimZ room's project root and grouped worktrees; the provider dashboard and store figures use account-global transcript totals.

The rest of this doc reads that frame zone by zone — what each zone shows and how it renders. Why the column ranks, groups, and routes the way it does is [the sidebar guide](../guide/sidebar.md); this page stays with what you see.

## Reading the glyphs

One vocabulary runs through the whole sidebar: a shape carries the meaning, color reinforces it. This is the complete legend, and the canonical home for it — every other doc points here.

The tables group glyphs by where they appear on screen: the **status cell** leading every row, the short-lived **heads** that ride over it, the **meters and stats** on cards and panels, and the **structure and chrome** around them. Find a glyph by where you saw it.

The tables show the default Unicode set. `[theme.glyphs]` can select Nerd Font or override either shipped inline set without changing the meanings; see [theme.md → Glyphs](../guide/theme.md#glyphs).

**Status — the leading cell of every agent row.**

| glyph | state | meaning | needs you |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `?`   | waiting    | asked you something; answer in its pane | yes |
| `!`   | attention  | a failed turn, a turn dead on a non-transient provider API error, or a working agent gone silent past the stall window | yes |
| `⏸`   | paused     | stopped mid-turn on a provider rate-limit, overload, or dropped/interrupted connection; resumes when the provider recovers or the window resets | on recovery |
| `⢿`   | working    | running and editing; the animation cycles through the braille frames (`⣾`, `⣽`, …), so any of them reads as working | no |
| `⠁`   | thinking   | running, before the turn's first file edit | no |
| `⠙`   | resolving  | a working-family spinner (the themable `resolving` animation, kin to `⠁` and `⢿`); a row wearing it is active and counts as working | no |
| `○`   | idle       | alive, nothing to do | no |
| `✓`   | done       | finished cleanly | a look, not the lead |
| `○`/`⢿` | process  | a pane with no agent (shell, editor): hollow `○` when idle, `⢿` while it does real work — the same shapes the idle and working agent rows wear, one soft step quieter, never a cockpit tally | no |

Mux tab names reuse the fixed representatives from this table as one suffix (`!`, `?`, `⏸`, `⢿`, or `✓`), choosing the tab's most urgent live agent. They do not animate: each glyph is a state label, while the sidebar row can animate within that same role.

Three short-lived **heads** ride over the base status on the leading cell, so they never earn a cockpit bucket of their own — every running agent, whichever head it wears, counts as **working** (`⢿`) in the make-up:

| head | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `⠁` thinking | the running turn before its first file edit — reasoning and reading, not yet writing; a research turn that never edits stays here end to end |
| `▇` compacting | condensing its context window, then returns to its resting head |
| `⢄` waiting on subagents | delegated to its children; the work is in the rows below |

Every head's shape, color, effect, and speed is per-machine theme through [`[theme.animations]`](../guide/theme.md#animations); the glyph shapes through [`[theme.glyphs]`](../guide/theme.md#glyphs).

**Attention and the unread inbox.** The two actionable glyphs hold a **fixed tone at any age** — `?` yellow, `!` red — and never heat toward a hotter color; `⏸` holds blue. What moves is the *unread* signal. A row reads unread from the moment it needs you until you focus its pane, and the sidebar marks it two ways: a soft **wash** fills the card the way a mail inbox shades an unread line, and the **one row that most needs you** — the oldest unanswered `?`/`!` — animates across its glyph, name, and description. Every other unread row, an unread `✓` result included, holds a steady bright crest instead, so exactly one pane is ever in motion and the eye lands on where to go next. The selected card keeps its own signature — the bright `▌` spine and recessed band — and wins when a card is both selected and unread.

A working agent gone silent past the stall window (`[agents.attention]`, 30 minutes by default) escalates to `!` — unless its provider window is spent without reset, which pauses (`⏸`) instead. A running agent that repeats the same tool with the same arguments shows `⟲` from 3 through 19 consecutive calls; at 20 the marker yields to `!` and the description reads `loop: <tool> ×<count>`. Any differing call clears the run. A parent waiting on subagents is exempt from the silence rule: its quiet wave is the children's work. A fresh idle agent collapses to identity plus any RimZ-authored description. Selecting it always opens the empty `▢` context meter below its description, or below an animated ellipsis compose affordance when it has no description; moving selection away restores the collapsed shape.

How the wash, the crest, and the lead-row motion are produced — `shimmer` vs. `bright` vs. `blink`, the age-paced cadence, the OKLab lift, and the per-depth and `NO_COLOR` fallbacks — is theme behavior: [theme.md → Unread attention](../guide/theme.md#unread-attention).

**Window — the model's context window on the identity line.** A lowercase magnitude token (`258k`, `1m`) closing the capability cluster on non-idle cards: the live out-of-band reading (Claude's statusline, Codex's app-server) when one exists, else a configured or exact model-metadata capacity, omitted until a source names it. An idle card drops the token. It is dim capability chrome, not a status signal, tinted louder as the window grows so the size reads at a glance; capacity alone does not create a context meter.

**Meters and stats — one grammar everywhere.** Each meter carries its value by shape, so it reads under `NO_COLOR`; the tone ramps that color it live in [theme.md → Display](../guide/theme.md#display).

| token | reads as |
|-------|----------|
| `▣ ━━━━╺━──── 38.2%` | context meter — how full the window is; the bar fills as used, `▢` hollow at 0%. Small windows draw linearly, and the fill curve grows with the window. The fill also shows *where* the window went: a wide cache-read run in the meter's health tone, with gap-fronted `╺` runs for cache-write and fresh-input accents; without cache reads, cache-write stays violet and fresh input vermilion while severity remains on `▣` and `▤`. Components at or above 0.5% of the filled window earn a half-cell floor, smaller components fold into the lead run, and the segmented fill meets the track without a trailing gap |
| `▤ 76k`           | filled context — the absolute tokens in the window, the `▣` meter's numerator |
| `◇ ↘ ↗ ◌` / `◍`   | token markers, one stable color each: `◇` total (blue) · `↘` input incl. cache creation (deep red, the costliest read) · `↗` output incl. thinking when reported separately (blue) · `◌` cache-read (green); a cumulative-only card uses these four without implying occupancy, while a current-context line adds `◍` cache-write (violet) for the per-call split |
| `97%`              | session cache hit — cached prompt input divided by cached plus cache-written plus fresh input; green at 90%+, yellow at 70–89%, red below 70%; absent before the session has input-side counters |
| `↻ N`             | completed context compactions — the card's lifetime count, from the first; trails the context line after a `·` (the same glyph marks provider budget resets and Codex reset credits — the last two rows of this table) |
| `⟲ N`             | consecutive identical tool calls — amber while the row stays running between the warning and attention thresholds; at the higher threshold it yields to `!` and the count moves into the `loop:` description |
| `◔ 5m`            | last-activity age — shown once it crosses five minutes, so a card stays quiet through normal churn; the face fills by the quarter hour (`◔`≤15m · `◑`≤30m · `◕`≤45m · `●`≤60m · `◉` past) and heats to red by the hour, where resuming likely re-reads the whole context uncached. A finished card heats on the same ramp, since prompting it again pays that same uncached re-read. On a running subagent line the same face reads the child's elapsed work as a fixed `m`/`h` label (`<1m` under a minute) |
| `C 11%` / `M 512M` / `⇅ 3M/s` | a working process row's CPU · resident memory (RSS) · combined VFS I/O rate — one fixed-width grid (`C` sky · `M` sage · `⇅` violet) that appears only once all three have values |
| `+127 -43`        | lines added / removed against the trunk — committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked all counted |
| `⇡3 ⇣1`           | commits ahead / behind the trunk (worktree header; zero components drop) |
| `≡ main`          | pristine worktree — clean, no worktree-owned commits, at the trunk tip |
| `✓ main`          | merged worktree — its work is landed and nothing remains to offer; remove it; the muted resting tone leaves the glyph to carry the verdict; a known PR verdict (`⑃`/`✕`/`✓`) overrides this local verdict |
| `⟳ main` / `✓ main` / `✕ main` / `⑃ main` / `≡ main` / `⑂ main` | trunk marker ladder: local rebase/merge/cherry-pick in progress, then PR merged, PR closed, PR open, then local merged, pristine, or plain branch; merged is muted, closed is red, and open stays cool |
| `✓ #91` / `✕ #91` / `◌ #91`; bare `✓` / `✕` / `◌` | the branch's CI verdict at its HEAD commit: passing in green, failing in red, or still running in amber; an open or merged pull request supplies the verdict beside its linked number, while a branch without a PR shows the bare glyph |
| `$1.27` / `$0.42` | spend — dollar green, two decimals, identical for provider totals and locally priced counters; omitted while a session's cost rounds to zero |
| `▰▱` / `▱▱` / `ex` / `api` | provider account bar: included-window budget (`5h`/`7d`/`30d`, or a provider- or plugin-defined label such as `bld`/`dep`, fill = left), unknown budget as a dim empty track, paid extra usage as `ex` (fill = left, with its whole-dollar budget beside it), API-key budget as `api` (fill = budget left, with `$left` beside it); an unbudgeted API key is a full bar with `∞`, which also marks an explicitly unlimited named quota or a currently lifted limit |
| `↻ 2h06m`         | when a provider budget resets; a known-duration window is soft at a sustainable burn pace, heating toward red as spend outruns the window or cooling toward green when spend runs well under it once enough of the window has elapsed; a durationless named quota keeps the reported countdown in the quiet tone because pace is unknowable — the duration form of `↻`, next to a budget bar (the count forms are compactions on a card and reset credits in the Codex header) |
| `↻ N`             | the count form of `↻`: on a card context line, completed compactions; in the Codex provider header, available rate-limit reset credits, with the glyph colored by soonest expiry and blinking while a spent window makes redemption useful |

**Structure and chrome.**

| mark | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `⌘ name`        | the workspace, with the name in the green `good` tone |
| `¤ N`           | the live agents in the room right now — the glyph in the agents' working clay |
| `⑃ N`           | open pull requests on agent lanes awaiting you — green when every known CI verdict passes, amber while one runs, red when one fails, and the cool PR-open tone while CI is unknown; click it to filter the body to those lanes |
| `◎ N`           | sessions (threads) that have run in the configured headline window (cockpit/provider) / in the store window — teal in both |
| `⧉ N`           | the subagents an agent spawned this turn (expanded card) — the marker violet, the label soft |
| `⋯ bg`          | an agent has background work pending — a faint secondary marker after the description that rides the settled `✓` as “done, background chore still running” |
| `⑂ name` / `⮌ name` | a group header with a git story — branch for pristine/diverged worktrees, merge for landed removable worktrees |
| `name` (bold)   | a directory room's own pod — name-only, no git story |
| `▎`             | the selection lane — the worktree you're in, a dim selection-tone bracket |
| `▌`             | the selected card's bright spine, over a `selection_bg` band that fills and recesses the whole card so it reads as one panel |
| `┄ external ┄`  | out-of-project panes (scripts, CI, stray shells) |
| `─`             | a section hairline |
| `▐` / `▕`       | the cards' scrollbar — thumb / track, shown while the viewport moves and settling away ~1s after it stops (`[theme.display] scrollbar` pins or removes it) |
| `┤ Tab ├`       | an active tab under `NO_COLOR` — the caps carry the pick by shape when the fill drops; make-up buckets keep their fixed cells and mark the pick with reverse video |
| `⇅ rc`          | remote control is on for that provider — green when its managed server is up (or pane sessions auto-enable), red when a configured server is down |
| `zᶻ idle` / `zᶻ idle · 17m` / `zᶻ away` | AFK presence in the footer — input has been idle for the configured idle window (`[sidebar] afk_after_secs`, 15 minutes by default) on tmux, with elapsed minutes added after the first minute, or no terminal client is attached |
| `⇄ remote 210ms` | remote SSH link badge in the footer — RTT EWMA; loss appears only above `10%`, and `⇄ remote ?` means the last stats are stale |

When two checkout groups render the same branch name, each header adds a muted `· repo` qualifier naming the shortest path suffix that distinguishes its checkout; unambiguous headers stay unchanged.

The AFK badge is quiet chrome: it appears only while away, uses the muted tone, and takes the footer's left edge. The remote-link badge yields to it and appears after two spaces only when the line still fits before the right-side shortcut reminder.

Remote-link badge tones are color-only: a healthy link reads green, then latency and loss slide it continuously through yellow and amber to red, bold at the critical end; a warming link stays neutral until it has an RTT sample. Under `NO_COLOR`, the numbers carry the state. The badge pins to the footer's left edge in the common active case, and the longest shortcut reminder that fits pins to the footer's right edge.

## Zone 1 — the cockpit

The top block. Fixed height, so the rows below it never jump as agents change state. Top to bottom it answers: *whose room is this, what's it costing, who needs me, and what has the fleet done.*

```
 ⌘ query-engine                    ~/code/query-engine

```

- **Identity.** The workspace name behind `⌘` renders in the green `good` tone, with the project path dim on the right edge (home-abbreviated to `~/…`; it left-truncates with a leading `…` before it ever crowds the name). A blank line sets it apart from the summary below.
- **Summary — who's here and what the headline window burned.** Two lines, each a colored glyph and soft-tier count on the left with headline numbers pinned right. Line 1 is the configured spend window at a glance: `◎` (teal) the sessions (threads) that have run in this room, with the room's accumulated token breakdown — `◇` total · `↘` input, including cache creation · `↗` output · `◌` cache-read, each marker in one color — pinned to the right edge in the coarse integer form. Before any spend arrives, the breakdown stays visible as zeroes. Line 2: `¤` (the agents' working clay) the live agents in the room right now, followed by a steady unread count like `(2)` when unseen rows exist, then `⑃ N` for open pull requests on the agent lanes' branches; the PR chip is red when any CI fails, amber while one is pending, green when all known lanes pass, and the cool PR-open tone when CI is unknown. The PR count is omitted when no lane has one. The room's spend stays pinned right. Clicking the unread count applies the unread lens, which stays active while you jump through matching cards; a second click, `A`, another filter pick, or unread reaching zero clears or replaces it. Clicking `⑃ N` applies the open-PR lens so only lanes whose branch has an open pull request remain, and that scope likewise persists across card jumps until an explicit clear or replacement, or the last open PR resolves. The counts read from the live room and the workspace-scoped JSONL tally's `[sidebar] spend_window`: `"session"` (default), `"24h"`, or `"today"` using the global `timezone`. An empty room reads `◎ 0` over `¤ 0` with `$0.00`.
- **Headline spend.** The room's workspace-scoped spend for the configured headline window, pinned to the right of the live-agents line, **counting up** in an eased odometer roll the moment any in-scope agent's cost moves — every jump lands inside 1.2s of 200ms clicks, big first steps easing into a penny-sized landing on the exact figure, with a brief brighten as it settles. Cumulative session values such as Cursor and Droid enter this aggregate and live budgets; replace-style current usage such as Antigravity stays card-only because it cannot be added over time. The value is always present, starting at `$0.00`; within one headline-window epoch it ratchets upward and resets when the configured spend window rolls.
- **Scope paths.** The workspace scope is path-prefix based over the project root and grouped worktree roots; a checkout reached through a different symlink spelling than the transcript's `cwd` can read as outside the room until the paths agree.
- **The make-up — split by who might want you.** The **left cluster** counts who needs an answer: `?` waiting, `!` failed, `⏸` paused, `✓` done. The **right cluster** is the live-capacity tail: `⢿` working (every running agent, whatever head it wears) and `○` idle. Every bucket always shows, zeros included, each in its semantic tone. A bucket carries the [unread signal](#reading-the-glyphs) only when it owns the lead unread row, so the make-up line mirrors the inbox without ever putting more than that one bucket in motion.
- **The unread jump banner — the agent that needs you, one click away.** The `↑ N need you` line appears when the lead unread card has scrolled out of view and stays hidden while that card is on screen, toned by the lead's status — yellow for a waiting lead, red for a failed one. Ranking puts the lead at the top; clicking the banner scrolls there and pins that view, while the inbox key (`n`/`Space`) jumps to and focuses the lead. It clears the moment nothing is awaiting you.
- **Each non-zero bucket is click-to-filter.** Clicking a bucket narrows the agent cards to that status, and the active scope applies in every tab of the room while you click or keyboard-jump through matching cards. Clicking the active bucket or pressing its active shortcut returns to all everywhere, `A` clears directly, another filter replaces it, answering the bucket down to zero invalidates it, and a zero bucket is inert. Keyboard filters mirror the buckets and the unread count: `u` unread, `q` waiting, `!`/`e` attention, `p` paused, `s` done, `w` working, `o` idle, `A` all. The waiting key is `q` (question), leaving `?` as the footer's help key; lowercase `a`/`d` resize the sidebar. The picked bucket paints as a padded chip for colored statuses — dark ink on the fill, bold, with one space on each side like the dashboard tab — while idle keeps the soft stat gray and adds reverse video and weight; the picked unread and open-PR lenses paint their cockpit counts as the same chip. Under `NO_COLOR`, reverse video marks the same fixed cells. The counts always span the full room, filtered or not, so the line stays the room's honest tally while the body narrows.

An **empty room** has no make-up line at all — just identity and the `◎ 0` / `¤ 0` summary:

```
 ⌘ query-engine

 ◎ 0                              ◇ 0 ↘ 0 ↗ 0 ◌ 0
 ¤ 0                                            $0.00
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Zone 2 — the agent cards

The body: one card per pane, grouped under the worktree it lives in. A worktree is total isolation — only same-worktree agents collaborate — so each group reads as one bounded block.

While a [make-up bucket](#zone-1--the-cockpit), the unread lens, or the open-PR lens is picked in any tab, every tab's body shows every matching card: non-matching rows, process rows, worktree groups left empty, and the `+K more` line all step aside until the pick clears, and the unfiltered cap does not apply.

**The cards scroll between the pinned zones.** When the cards outgrow the pane they scroll between the cockpit and the dashboard — both stay put — and the right-margin scrollbar (`▐` thumb, `▕` track) appears while the viewport moves. The viewport follows the **selection**: picking any row brings its card, expanded subagent list included, fully into view, pinning a too-tall card's first line to the top. The mouse wheel scrolls freely without moving the selection — peek anywhere, and the next selection change snaps the view back. `?` swaps the card body for the keys-and-filter overlay while the cockpit, footer, and alert rails stay pinned.

### The card

An agent is a small stacked card. The standard resting card is four lines. An idle agent with no prompt or session history stays fresh: it is identity-only without a descriptor and identity + description when launched with one. Selecting any fresh card adds the empty meter, with an animated compose affordance filling the description slot when no authored description exists; a selected described fresh card is identity + description + empty meter. Submitting any prompt engages the card for good: it holds identity, description, meter, and stats lines while data fills in place, using `▢ 0%` and `▤ 0` before the first measurement. Selecting an engaged card appends any subagents and lights the spine, so its standard lines never reflow. If it belongs to a named team, every visible teammate expands at the same time, but the spine and selection band stay on the selected card alone.

`[theme.display] card_density` tunes that body without changing routing: `auto` uses the standard card, `expanded` shows subagents on every parent card, and `compact` trims resting cards by status while selection opens the selected card and any visible named teammates to their lifecycle stages' full shapes. Compact resting cards read idle as identity only, running/waiting as identity + description + meter (including the `▢ 0%` placeholder), and paused/done/failed as identity + description.

- **Line 1 — identity.** The animated leading cell, then the agent's handle — its team role, explicit name, or profile, else the kind — in the provider brand color (so a team reads `planner` / `coder` / `reviewer`; unknown kinds mid-gray), then capability: model · one reasoning-configuration token (effort or `thinking`) · window token, dim metadata under the brand-colored name. Capability degrades by width — wide carries model · reasoning configuration · window, medium drops reasoning configuration, narrow keeps just the name; the window token rides non-idle cards only. The `$cost` pins right and joins the line once the card has a nonzero price (an idle agent at `$0.00` shows nothing), counting up in the same eased odometer roll as the cockpit headline. Provider totals and locally priced counters render identically. Cumulative session values join the headline aggregate; Antigravity's replace-style current usage stays card-only when its canonical model ID or qualified selector label resolves to the local price table, without claiming subscription billing or creating provider-history/stat records.
- **Line 2 — what it's on.** The label falls through a priority list until something names the session: Codex thread metadata (`preview`, then `name`) first, then the named session (`--name` / `/rename`), the launch or adapter-reported `description`, the agent's task, the session's first usable prompt, and finally its latest prompt. The first-prompt slot stays fixed across later turns so an unnamed session keeps one label. An idle agent with nothing yet collapses to the identity line. A turn that died on a provider API error takes the line over with the upstream error text (`API Error: Overloaded`) for as long as its `!` holds, so the card says why without a jump ([model.md → displayed status](../internals/agents/model.md#displayed-status)).
- **The context meter (`▣`/`▢`).** The resting card's one bar: `▢` hollow at 0%, including before the first measurement, and `▣` once anything fills it; the value is always the raw percent *used*. The drawn fill's log curve grows with the context window: windows up to 256k stay linear, and 1M windows use the full curve to keep useful visual resolution through their working range; linear geometry remains configurable. Supported kitty-graphics paths move the fill edge at pixel precision; every other flat bar rounds to the nearest half cell, and any nonzero fill keeps a one-pixel or half-cell floor. The fill also shows *where* the window went — a dominant cache-read run in the current health tone, with gap-fronted `╺` runs for cache-write (`◍`) and fresh-input (`↘`) accents. When cache reads are absent, the bar uses only the flat composition tones (violet cache-write and vermilion fresh input); severity remains visible on the `▣` and `▤` glyphs. Components at or above 0.5% of the filled window earn the cell bar's half-cell floor; smaller components fold into the lead run, and the segmented fill rounds to a whole cell so its final accent meets the track without a trailing gap. A row with no per-call split yet paints one flat run. The health bands, fill geometry, and pixel tier are tunable ([theme.md → Display](../guide/theme.md#display)).
- **The stats line.** Before token data arrives it reads `▤ 0`; all-zero composition columns drop whole. With current-window data, it is the meter's absolute companion: `▤` is `input + cache-write + cache-read` of the latest API call, the numerator the `▣` percent scales, followed after a `·` by `◌` cache-read, `◍` cache-write, `↘` fresh input, and `↗` output. A provider-reported occupancy without categories renders as the bare `▤ total` and a flat meter; Qwen adds transcript categories only while their filled-input sum matches its live scalar. A zero or unreported column drops whole, so a cache-write marker appears only for a reported nonzero write; these columns stay disjoint per call, unlike the fleet lines whose `↘` subsumes cache-write. When current-window occupancy is absent and a provider exposes only cumulative session counters, as stock-pane Droid does, the line instead uses `◇ total ↘ input ↗ output ◌ cache-read`; cache creation folds into input and separately reported thinking folds into output. Cumulative categories never establish gauge occupancy or a `▤` composition. When cumulative input-side counters exist, the trailing plain percent is the session cache-hit ratio and uses the shared green/yellow/red health bands. A completed-compaction count joins as `· ↻ N` from the first, and the last-activity age pins right once it crosses five minutes (a delegating parent reads the freshest of its own and its children's activity).

The `▣`/`▢` and `▤` glyphs share one lead column, so the card reads as an aligned grid.

**Selection.** In `auto` and `expanded`, the resting card is the four lines above. Selecting any row lights the bold `▌` spine and *appends* the agent's subagents beneath — it never reshapes a line already on screen, so the card never reflows. Selecting a named-team member expands every visible teammate's card in the same way, without giving those teammates the selected spine or band:

```

The expanded card also lists any **subagents** the agent spawned this turn. A `⧉ subagents (N)` header (the marker violet, the label soft) opens the list, then one entry per child in spawn order (creation time ascending, stable across refreshes). Nested Codex descendants remain in this flat root-owned list and keep their root-relative task path as detail. Each entry leads with the same live head an agent row wears — the `⠁` thinking animation while the child reasons, the `⢿` working fill while it acts, the static verdict once it lands — followed by the child's nickname/type and task. A deeper-indented second line carries available reported tokens `◇` and model/effort metadata. While the child runs, its live elapsed work pins right — the clock-fill glyph (filling with the child's worked span) over a fixed three-cell `m`/`h` label (`<1m` under a minute, never seconds), toned by the age ramp. That line is a per-card grid — the figure right-aligned, the model padded to the widest sibling, a missing field blank-filling its slot — so the metadata stacks into columns across children. A **finished** child keeps exact token/model/effort metadata but drops the elapsed clock; a metadata-free completion still collapses to its single type line:

Claude's description, cumulative tokens, and precise start time ride in from `subagentStatusLine` (Claude-only, harvested at install time). The same feed incrementally prices every request in that child's dedicated transcript; when every model resolves, the exact cumulative figure pins right on line 1. Any unpriced request hides the figure rather than showing a partial sum, and providers without a dedicated per-child transcript show no child cost. The figure is display-only: Claude's parent session spend already includes the child, so it never joins parent, room, or provider totals. Codex reads nickname, task path, role, model/effort, and current context tokens from the child rollout around each hook; its elapsed fallback starts at durable child registration. Copilot reads the model from the parent's start record and reconciles the exact total from the completion record at the next parent checkpoint. Siblings on different models read apart at a glance and a reasoning child uses the same thinking animation its parent would. A child with no enrichment shows just its `glyph type` line. Subagents have no pane of their own, so they never get a row; they nest here only.

### Attention rows

A waiting or failed agent is the whole point. Its glyph leads, bold, and the card rises to the top of its worktree:

```

```

A `?` waiting row reads the same with a `?` glyph. The row carries *who* needs you and *what task*, and selecting it lands you in the agent's pane, where the full prompt and its safe defaults live — that is the row's job, to route you there.

### Process rows

A pane no agent has stamped reads like a slim agent card, one soft step quieter: a hollow `○` for an idle shell or editor, the `⢿` spinner for a pane doing real work (a build, test, install), the program name in the soft middle tier. Inside a worktree group the process rows settle below the agent cards, the recession reading them as the group's command tail rather than more agents. An active pane anchors its primary line on the shell that owns it, so it stays put as commands come and go, and carries the live command on a second line with the program trimmed to its name and arguments verbatim; a working or stuck row pins the [resource grid](#reading-the-glyphs) (`C`/`M`/`⇅`) into the same right slot a card gives its `$cost`, while an idle shell stays bare even when values exist.

```

⢿ zsh                        C  34%  M 512M  ⇅   8M/s
    cargo build --release
```

The label is the program the pane runs, read past a `sudo` wrapper and through a `node`/`npx` launcher (`sudo npm install -g @openai/codex` is an `npm` install, not a codex agent; `node …/codex` is codex). No status, no meter, never counted in the cockpit — it is presence, not a cue. It is still a jump target, and the moment an agent's hook stamps that pane it becomes that agent's card.

### Worktree groups and the selection lane

Worktrees stack as bounded blocks under quiet neutral headings, so the names organize the column without competing with attention or the selection. The worktree **holding your selection** reads as one bracketed lane: a dim `▎` spine and dotted `┄` seal down its header and every row, then the selected card lit with the bright `▌` spine over the recessed `selection_bg` band — subagents included — so the selected block reads as one card. Every other worktree carries a blank gutter, so the lane and band are the only selection markers on screen and the pane you're in is unmistakable.

The worktree header carries the worktree's git story on the right: local reconciling (`⟳`) takes the top marker, then a forge PR verdict — merged (`✓`), closed (`✕`), or open (`⑃`) — outranks the local trunk verdict: merged (`✓`), pristine (`≡`), or plain branch (`⑂`). The verdict ladder renders merged as muted settled history, closed as red, and open in the cool link tone. Diverged and reconciling worktrees show the `⇡`/`⇣` commit delta against the trunk, then the total diff, then the marker; a merged PR drops those spent figures even when squash-merge ancestry leaves the branch diverged, while a closed PR keeps them. Pristine, merged, and PR-clean worktrees also collapse to the marker alone. The `+/-` churn counts committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked file content, so work `git diff` cannot see still reads as work. The trunk worktree itself wears no pristine/merged verdict — "landed on itself" says nothing, so its header keeps the plain cluster. The trunk is auto-detected (`main` → `master` → the remote's default) and overridable per machine ([configuration](../guide/configuration.md#sidebar-rendering)).

A branch's CI verdict at its HEAD commit shows beside the worktree name as `✓`, `✕`, or `◌` for passing, failing, or pending. A linked pull request shows its `#N` after that glyph in the cool link tone and supplies the verdict while open or merged; a branch without a PR shows the bare CI glyph. Identity and CI stay beside the name while the PR state stays on the right marker.

A worktree channel leads with the fork (`⑂`) or merge (`⮌`) glyph like a worktree pod, shows a linked PR's `#N` beside the channel name, and carries the same right-pinned git story: commit delta, churn, and the PR or merge glyph. A plain named or directory lane with no git story keeps the `# name` header.

```

The `external` block is the catch-all for panes outside the project — untethered scripts, CI, stray shells. It renders as a dim divider rather than a worktree header, always sorts last, and keeps an attention-only `? n` / `! n` tally so an out-of-project ask still surfaces from the tail.

A [directory room](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) groups git-backed agents by the worktree root their hooks resolve, at any depth in the room: each active checkout keeps the full `⑂` header with its own git story, while the panes the room root itself holds sit under a **name-only header** — the directory's basename in bold, no fork glyph, no git cluster, because a plain directory has neither a fork nor a trunk to measure against. It is still a jump target and still wears the selection lane.

```

**Ranking is automatic: unread, hot, warm, then archived.** Within a worktree, rows first sort by inbox and age band, then by a fixed-point attention score: `waiting`, `failed`, and `paused` heat as their clock approaches the one-hour boundary, warm rows decay until 24 hours, and archived rows park below current work. Calm rows keep stable pane order within equal states, and worktrees sort by their most-urgent member, then by calm activity — working, all-success, idle, process-only — before git state refines ties. A non-dirty merged or closed group with no running or attention member enters the archive immediately.

**The cap.** Each active worktree shows a capped number of rows with a dim `+K more`. Click `+K more` to expand that group in place; the expanded live group shows every row and a dim `− less` line that collapses it. The ordinary cap trims only the idle/process tail; active, blocked, paused, finished, unread, and focused rows stay visible. A finished group with several agents collapses as one unit to a muted-bold header and two-line dim receipt, hiding unread success too; a finished group with one agent keeps its card visible even beside process rows, and a process-only group stays expanded. A merged verdict leaves only its marker on the header. The expandable `▸` roster leads at the content edge with the shared team name when present, then each member's status glyph and softened provider-brand name, folds overflow and process rows into `+n`, and pins the cohort's rounded lifetime transcript cost right; the totals line shows the same lifetime token split followed by the aggregate cache-hit percentage and pins retained active time right, falling back to finished age when that sidecar has expired. These figures cover every resumed session of each durable team seat and agree with attribution and the team catalogue. Expanding a finished receipt puts each seat's lifetime cost on its member card, so the cards add back to the pin; live cards keep the current session's self-reported cost. A narrow multi-agent roster falls back to `▸ +K done`; click the header or either receipt line, use the `s` status filter, or focus a member to reveal the full roster, then click the header to collapse it. A focused or order-held member reveals every card, so the pod is never half-collapsed:

### Jump — the row is the link

You don't read where to go; you go. Selecting a row focuses that pane — no mux pane number is ever shown.

- `↑`/`↓` or `k`/`j` select a row; `K`/`J` select the previous or next worktree's first visible row; `g`/`G` select the first or last row; `↵` or `l` jumps to the selected pane.
- `n`/`N` jump to the **next/previous thing that needs you** — unread needs-a-look rows first, oldest episode first, then read waiting/failed rows oldest first — and focus it to read. `␣` is an alias for `n`. One key tames a fleet; `N` walks back.
- `1`–`9` jump by the row's visible position.
- `m` toggles the selected row read/unread **without jumping**; `M` marks every row read.
- `u`, `q`, `!`/`e`, `p`, `s`, `w`, and `o` filter the body to unread/waiting/attention/paused/done/working/idle; the active filter key toggles back to all, and `A` clears to all directly.
- `a`/`d` calculate and persist a validated narrower/wider absolute target, then every tab converges to the smallest reachable width at or above it; resize feedback confirms progress without redefining the target, and a new session resets it.
- `←/→` switch the provider dashboard's tab when the dashboard is tabbed — a provider pick in place, never a jump.
- A click anywhere in a card's block jumps to it.
- The mouse wheel scrolls the card list without moving the selection; the next selection change snaps the view back to the selected card.

From any pane in the room, the configurable `Alt+p` ([configuration](../guide/configuration.md#sidebar-rendering)) focuses the sidebar and toggles back to your last working pane — the one key that reaches the room from inside an agent.

## Zone 3 — the provider dashboard

The budgets are account-scoped — every session of a provider shares one account's budget — so they pin to a panel at the bottom rather than riding the rows. Accounts default to usage-rank order (running, recently used, then recently logged in); display config controls how they stack or tab and can override the order (`provider_tabs`, `provider_list`, `max_provider_blocks`; [theme.md → Display](../guide/theme.md#display)).

In **tabbed** mode the panel's top hairline becomes a tab rail naming every provider, the active tab a brand-filled bold chip (the rail's glyphs are identical across tabs, so a switch moves color and weight alone; `┤ ├` caps mark the pick under `NO_COLOR`). One account's block paints at a time, so the budgets read one account deep, and the header reads plan-first (`Claude Max · v2.1.169`; `v?` until a source reports the binary version, the plan label absent until the account surface names one). With pets disabled the active tab **follows the selected pane's provider** — select a codex pane and the dashboard reads its ChatGPT account, a process pane falls to the first tab; `←`/`→` or a click picks one by hand until you select a pane of a different provider. Every logged-in account earns its block even when idle this run, so your budgets show between turns — kept current by per-provider out-of-band refresh ([providers.md](../internals/agents/providers.md)).

With `[theme.pets] enabled = true`, the active provider block narrows and one pane-local companion rides its right edge, driven by fused fleet state plus a canned caption. It renders as true pixels where tmux passthrough and the terminal support kitty graphics, else as sextant cell art in `auto`. Pixel pets reserve `15×9` cells and cell-art pets reserve `18×9` cells; in the dashboard both tiers get one empty row underneath, so the art ends one row above the panel bottom and the provider block keeps identical height across tiers. The rail still shows provider tabs only, and the same `←`/`→` and click controls pick a tab. The provider block keeps its auto layout tiers — wide the full historical row, normal the taller totals block beside the pet column, narrow dropping token splits then version text as it crowds — and the sprite drops out entirely under `NO_COLOR` or when the pane is too narrow to hold it.

Each block with historical usage speaks the fleet store's vocabulary, scoped to the provider: the configured headline `◎` session count, then the `◇ ↘ ↗ ◌` token breakdown, where `↘` input subsumes cache creation, with the spend pinned right. A ledgerless block keeps that full row in place: `◎` carries the number of identity-bearing sessions active in this room, while the unavailable token and dollar positions show dim `–` placeholders rather than invented zeroes. The stats row stays one row in every provider layout; normal and narrow hide the input/output split only when the width needs it. The `Total:` delimiter switches from provider-headline facts to the separate account-global fleet totals. Wide paints `W:` and `M:` as two full rows with USD pinned right; normal and narrow split each token row into a left `W:`/`M:` session cluster and right-aligned token stats, then put `W: $...` on the left and `M: $...` on the right of the third total row. A cold or empty fleet cache keeps those global rows and reads `$0.00`; the ledgerless provider headline does not synthesize one.

A **metered account** drains one "mana" bar per included budget window toward its reset. The bar fills with what's *left*, sliding continuously green → gold → amber → red as it empties over a dim empty track — and a fully-spent window (0% left) flips its whole empty track red, so an exhausted budget never reads as an untouched one. Each window's label (`5h`/`7d`, Copilot's token-billed AI Credit `cr`, or a compact provider- or plugin-defined label such as `bld`/`dep`) occupies the shared three-cell slot and wears its own bar's tone, while the `↻` reset countdown beside it wears the spend pace: soft when the current burn rate sustains to reset, then sliding gold → amber → red as it outruns the window, or cooling toward green once spend falls to about 1.5x under pace and reaching full green at 3x under pace after the early-window gate, with the quiet soft tier as the fallback when pace is unknowable. A spent longer duration window gates the shorter duration ones: once the `7d` is exhausted the `5h` row is painted exhausted too — red, no countdown — regardless of its own reading, since that budget is unusable until the longer window resets. Named quotas are independent: an exhausted `bld` lane does not paint `dep` exhausted, and both remain visible rather than yielding a row to the temporal extra-credit substitution. When a spent duration window puts the account on known-usable paid extra usage, `ex` takes the first row and the longest included window stays on the second, filled when usable or exhausted with its reset. Unknown or exhausted extra credits keep the spent window first instead. A known extra-usage limit reads as its whole-dollar budget (`$50`) while the bar still shows the percentage left. Without a limit, a known remaining balance or usage reads dollars, and a wholly unknown value reads `∞` over a dim empty track.

These are **sliding windows** that begin counting only on your first token, so until then the provider keeps sliding the reset a full window-length ahead. A window whose reset still sits ~a full window out has **not started** (it still reads ~1% used, not 0 — so it's the reset distance that gives it away). Any usage above that ~1% floor means it has already started, countdown and all; only a 0–1% window with a near-full reset qualifies. A not-started window shows a near-full bar with **no countdown**, reading "ready — send a message to start it" rather than a misleading ticking placeholder; the countdown appears once your first token fixes the reset and it begins ticking down.

A named quota with no reported duration does not participate in sliding-window detection, burn pace, surplus, temporal hierarchy, or reset-to-max roll-forward. Its provider-reported reset remains visible in the quiet tone and can arm a genuinely exhausted turn; `∞` remains visible for an explicitly unlimited named quota.

When the provider temporarily lifts a previously reported limit, its row stays visible as a full bar with `∞` in the countdown marker slot; unlike a not-started window's blank slot, this explicitly reads as unlimited until the provider reports the window again.

When RimZ is reading only cached budgets and the longest cached duration window has already reset, the balance is unknown until the provider refreshes. If every cached window lacks a reset, the newest reading likewise becomes unknown once its shortest reported duration has elapsed. Each named durationless quota becomes unknown independently when its reported reset passes rather than rolling forward. The panel keeps the account and window labels, but an unknown cached budget row becomes a dim empty track with no countdown, so it does not claim either a refreshed full budget or an exhausted one. A metered account whose window list has not arrived yet paints one labeled dim track for each descriptor-declared expected window, preserving the eventual budget grid without inventing a reading; an unknown or unstable provider shape keeps one anonymous track as the fallback.

Provider blocks stacked (`theme.display.provider_tabs = "never"`). Claude and Codex use account-global provider totals; Pi is shown as an idle API-key block to pin its curated catalog emblem:

An **unmetered** account (an API key) shows an `api` budget bar. A configured display ceiling drains against trailing-month transcript spend and places the remaining dollars at the right; spend stays in the stats row above. With no configured budget, the bar is full and reads `∞`. The dashboard isn't pinned to fixed windows — each is labeled by its reported length, and paid usage earns a separate `ex` row only when it matters to the account's usable budget.

A **Pi block** names its version and the backing account it runs on — `Pi v0.80.6 · Anthropic OAuth`. Pi keeps its budget readings under the `pi` provider: live sessions publish response-header windows, idle OAuth accounts refresh out-of-band, and an API key gets the `api` budget row instead ([providers.md → Per-provider mapping](../internals/agents/providers.md#per-provider-mapping)).

Every bar shares one start column and one end column whichever tab is active, so the dashboard reads as one aligned grid. The `⇅ rc` flag pins to the block's top-right when remote control is on for that provider — green when its managed server is up (or pane sessions auto-enable), red when a configured server is down. The host stays infrastructure, never its own row. Codex can also pin `↻ N` in that header cluster when reset credits are available; the count stays neutral, and the glyph moves red → amber → yellow → green as the nearest credit gets farther from expiry, resting grey at a week or more. Below ~34 columns the emblem is dropped and the bars run full-width. Above that threshold the clipped emblem rows resolve as one shape, centered together within the fixed provider-art gutter so narrow catalog and theme-supplied marks keep one axis; full-width marks retain their position and tint ranges stay attached to the original art. The brand emblem resolves from the embedded catalog with a shared fallback, while emblem, color, and name remain configurable through `[theme.providers.<kind>]` (see [theme.md](../guide/theme.md#provider-styling)).

### The fleet store

The account-global running totals seal the bottom of the dashboard, above the footer — a quiet two-row store you learn to glance at, never a cue that competes with the rows. The trailing-week (`W:`) and trailing-month (`M:`) rows span every provider.

```
 W: ◎ 420  ◇ 202.9M ↘ 175.1M ↗ 27.8M ◌  5.2B $3,888.88
 M: ◎ 860  ◇ 420.0M ↘ 366.0M ↗ 54.0M ◌ 10.8B $8,666.66
```

- **The rows.** Each reads `◎ sessions  ◇ total ↘ input ↗ output ◌ cache-read  $spend` — the precise one-decimal record beside the cockpit's coarse live read, every field right-aligned into one shared grid so the `W:`/`M:` labels stack and the columns line up. Cache creation folds into the `↘` input figure, keeping the store to the headline numbers.
- **No animation.** The store figures are static — the count-ups live above, the configured headline in the cockpit and each card's `$cost`. The windows escalate `headline → week → month`.

Every figure is computed from the transcript JSONL — Codex's dollars priced from its token counts, every provider that logs usage counted, all of them account-global. The store reads the last persistent account-global totals when they exist, and `$0.00` until something has been recorded.

## Bottom chrome

Pinned to the bottom edge, below all three zones. The body is truncated before this chrome is ever clipped, so it can never scroll off.

**Footer.** Faint chrome — the deepest legible gray, receding to pure scaffolding. The right edge keeps the configured room-wide sidebar toggle visible beside the in-pane help key:

```
                       Alt+p sidebar/back · ? for help
```

`Alt+p` focuses the sidebar from any pane and toggles back to the previous working pane. The label follows `[sidebar] focus_key`; an unbound or invalid focus key falls back to `? for help` rather than advertising a chord that cannot fire. Narrow panes preserve the action first, shortening the copy to `Alt+p sidebar · ?`, then `Alt+p sidebar` or `Alt+p · ?` as left-side presence and link badges consume space.

When the room is AFK, the footer adds a muted sleep badge at the left edge and keeps help on the right. tmux reports both detached and attached-but-idle after the configured idle window (`[sidebar] afk_after_secs`, 15 minutes by default), so it shows `zᶻ idle` during the first minute and then `zᶻ idle · 17m`; Zellij reports attached/detached only, so it shows `zᶻ away` once every terminal client detaches:

```
zᶻ idle · 17m         Alt+p sidebar/back · ? for help
```

**Pane-source notice.** When the producer repairs a partial pane read by carrying live panes from the prior frame, a dim line appears above the footer while the room stays interactive:

```
 ⚠ pane source degraded · 2 carried panes · 8s
```

When the renderer is holding a successful-but-regressive fetch behind the last good frame, the same layer says why the rows are intentionally stale:

```
 ⚠ pane updates held · empty pane frame
```

These notices clear when the next accepted pane frame lands. A health alert takes over the bottom line while a fetch failure is active.

**Help overlay** (`?`). The keys, status filters, and standalone sidebar-focus chord float over the bottom-right of the card body, next to the footer hint, while uncovered cards stay visible. Key chords use the cool accent tone, and any key or focus leaving the sidebar closes it.

**Health alert.** When the refresh loop can't read the room, a sticky line takes over the bottom and the footer steps aside — an empty body under a failed fetch is a missing snapshot, not an empty room:

```
 ⚠ Sidebar degraded for 8s: snapshot failed: store not found
```

On recovery it doesn't vanish; it lingers as a dim, dismissable notice so a failure that flickered past is still visible after the fact:

```
 ⚠ last alert 8s ago: snapshot failed: store not found  ·  x dismiss
```

Press `x` to dismiss it; a fresh failure re-arms it. `r` reloads the tab.

## Keeping these frames honest

The renderer's golden tests in [`crates/rimz/src/sidebar_pane/render/`](../../crates/rimz/src/sidebar_pane/render/) are the machine-checked source of truth for these frames — `cargo xtask test` re-renders each scenario and diffs it against a committed `.snap`. The frames in this doc are drawn from those scenarios:

| scenario | golden test |
|----------|-------------|
| narrow card | `l0_density_minimal_row` |
| capability + window | `agent_capability` |
| selected, enriched card | `enriched_selected_agent_card` |
| card context line + age pin | `agent_card_context_age` |
| card context line + compactions | `agent_card_context_compactions` |
| codex card composition (no `◍`) | `codex_card_context_composition` |
| process row + resource stats | `process_row_resource_stats` |
| agents + dimmed process tail | `agents_process_tail` |
| subagent list + elapsed column | `subagent_two_line_entry` |
| worktree grouping + external | `worktree_attention_map` |
| equal-to-trunk header (`≡`) | `worktree_equal_to_trunk` |
| clear worktree header (`✓`) | `worktree_clear_safe_to_remove` |
| dirty tree blocks the markers | `worktree_dirty_tree_keeps_the_cluster` |
| per-worktree cap | `group_cap_with_overflow` |
| cockpit unread count | `cockpit_unread_count` |
| unread jump banner | `unread_jump_banner` |
| make-up bucket picked, body filtered | `make_up_filter_failed` |
| unread lens picked, body filtered | `make_up_filter_unread` |
| cards overflow, scrollbar mid-scroll | `scroll_overflow_shows_bar` |
| selection-driven scroll to bottom, bar settled away | `scroll_offset_follows_selection_to_bottom` |
| tall expanded card pinned to top | `scroll_pins_tall_expanded_card_top` |
| wheel pin holds the viewport | `scroll_manual_offset_holds` |
| scrollbar hidden once settled | `scrollbar_hides_after_settle` |
| scrollbar pinned (`always`) | `scrollbar_always_mode` |
| scrollbar removed (`never`) | `scrollbar_never_mode` |
| provider dashboard, tabbed (derived tab) | `provider_dashboard` |
| provider dashboard, manual tab pick | `provider_dashboard_codex_tab` |
| provider dashboard, stacked auto layout | `provider_dashboard_stacked` |
| fleet store (week/month) | `fleet_store` |
| health alert | `degraded_banner` |
| pane-source notice | `render_truth_degraded_notice_keeps_room_chrome` |

When the renderer changes how something looks, update the `.snap` (the test prints the diff) and this doc together.
