RimZ serves every local Zellij and tmux room through one Basic-authenticated writable ttyd daemon and serves explicitly shared rooms through a separate unauthenticated, input-blocked broadcast daemon; both bind loopback by default.

## Contract

The daemon owns browser transport and rendering; RimZ owns room birth, session validation, attach argv, credential state, URL construction, diagnostics, and remote SSH forwarding.

The store, hooks, sidebar, and wake paths are unchanged for a browser client, and RimZ proxies no pane I/O.

`[web] interface` selects both bind addresses, `port` selects the writable listener at 8200 by default, and `share_port` selects the broadcast listener at 8201 by default. The writable daemon can reach every room after machine-wide authentication; the broadcast daemon reaches only its durable allowlist.

## Daemon

ttyd uses this structurally fixed authentication argv in every mode:

```text
ttyd -W -O -a -P 3600 -c rimz:<secret> -i 127.0.0.1 -p <port> [-t <client-option>...] [-I <custom-index>] <current-rimz-exe> web exec
```

`-W` enables input, `-O` enforces origin checks, `-a` appends ttyd's internal URL `arg` values to the command, `-P 3600` checks WebSocket liveness once an hour, and `-i` selects ttyd's listener. libwebsockets closes a socket when its pong misses a grace window fixed at seven seconds past the configured interval; a browser that has stopped draining a saturated stream can miss that window, so ttyd's five-second default closes busy terminals and silently reattaches the room. `-P 0` means ping continuously and starves ttyd's output pump rather than disabling the check. Keep the interval at or below 65528 because ttyd stores the interval plus seven in a `uint16_t`; 3600 stays inside that bound while reducing the failure opportunity to one ping per hour per tab. RimZ exposes `room` in browser URLs and its injected WebSocket shim maps that value to `arg` for ttyd. Trusted-header authentication changes the edge in front of ttyd; it never changes ttyd's Basic-authenticated core.

tmux can emit a full repaint for each drag coordinate, while ttyd 1.7.7 does not stop its output pump when the browser sends its flow-control pause command. In a live 179x38 trace, roughly 63 motion reports per second made tmux's authoritative pane width advance only about once every two seconds even though xterm's parse-callback backlog stayed at zero. The browser compatibility layer therefore bounds motion admission proactively: the leading report sends immediately, motion slower than one report per 50 milliseconds passes through unchanged, and faster motion retains only the newest coordinate for the next 50-millisecond slice. Button presses, releases, and non-mouse input flush the latest coordinate first, so the final drag endpoint remains exact. The layer never gates WebSocket reads.

tmux also clears every xterm mouse mode before re-enabling the desired set whenever a pane changes its requested tracking mode. Xterm.js 5.4.0 removes its document-level held-drag listeners when `?1002l` arrives, but the following `?1002h` restores only protocol flags; it installs those listeners again only on a mousedown. RimZ keeps independent capture-phase pointer state and observes xterm's protocol changes. When drag reporting returns while the primary button is still held, it dispatches one synthetic mousedown to reinstall xterm's listeners and swallows the resulting press frame before the pacing state or WebSocket sees it. The shim feature-detects xterm's `coreMouseService` protocol event so an incompatible ttyd bundle fails the live regression rather than guessing at a private API.

Add `rimzdebug=1` to the room URL to expose the live pacing state and a bounded decision history at `window.__rimzWeb` for field diagnosis, including drag re-arm and swallowed-press decisions.

Basic mode with `image_paste = false` and an empty `trusted_proxies` list binds ttyd directly to `<interface>:<port>`. Image paste, a non-empty proxy list, or trusted-header mode starts ttyd first on `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>`, waits for that upstream, starts the hidden detached `rimz web gate` process on the configured listener, waits for the public listener, and only then writes daemon state. Image paste also gives that same gate process a second ephemeral loopback listener for SSH web tunnels; the public and internal listeners share the upload store, while only the internal listener accepts the tunnel relay's injected Basic credential instead of trusted-header identity. Startup tears down every process already started when a later step fails.

The gate parses the configured bare IPs and IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs before any process change. Trusted-header and explicitly restricted listeners accept loopback peers plus peers inside a matching same-family CIDR and drop every other connection; a Basic-only public gate created for image paste retains direct ttyd's source-neutral behavior and relies on Basic Auth. Trusted-header mode parses each HTTP request head, requires exactly one occurrence of the configured header with a non-empty trimmed value, optionally requires a byte-exact case-sensitive match in `auth_users`, removes any client `Authorization`, and injects `Authorization: Basic <machine-credential>` before forwarding; a rejected identity receives 401, request bodies with `Content-Length` pass unchanged, chunked requests close, keep-alive requests are checked independently, and a WebSocket upgrade switches to a raw splice. Responses pass unchanged.

The writable browser bootstrap captures the first clipboard file whose MIME starts with `image/` and sends its bytes to `POST /__rimz/upload/image` with credentials plus `X-RimZ-Upload: image`. The custom header is a CSRF boundary ordinary cross-site forms cannot produce. The gate authenticates before reading the body, requires one exact custom header and a non-zero `Content-Length`, rejects lengths above 20 MiB, and never exposes the route on the broadcast listener. The upload store canonicalizes the system temporary root, creates a per-uid mode `0700` directory, recognizes PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF from magic bytes, writes a UUIDv7-named mode `0600` file, and opportunistically removes regular files older than 24 hours. Its JSON response carries one lossless UTF-8 absolute path; the browser shell-quotes that path through xterm's paste operation without submitting Enter.

Room URLs have the shape `<base>/?room=<percent-encoded-session>`. The injected client maps `room` to ttyd's `arg` when it opens the WebSocket, while passing a legacy `?arg=` query through unchanged; ttyd appends the decoded session to the hidden shim as `rimz web exec <session>`.

The shim accepts only a session with a durable RimZ workspace record and a matching live mux session. It never treats the browser argument as an argv fragment. On terminal stdio, a valid target delegates to the shared `rimz sessions` picker in Web mode: it runs the tmux or Zellij attach as a child, then presents the list when that child ends. Non-terminal stdio keeps exec replacement with `tmux -S <managed-socket> attach -t <session>` or `zellij attach <session>`; the separately validated share shim also keeps its read-only exec path.

A missing, unknown, or stopped target on terminal stdio opens the themed session manager. It joins durable workspace records with one live mux probe, ranks rooms whose latest snapshot `turn_started_at` falls within 24 hours by that prompt recency, ranks the remaining rooms by the workspace record's `updated_at`, and filters by displayed repository name and path. On a full-size terminal, its 24-row box uses 40% of the terminal width within 58- to 84-column bounds and leaves unused list rows empty; constrained screens keep the compact full-frame fallback. It attaches the selected room as an inherited-stdio child after releasing raw input while preserving the alternate screen and mouse reporting. Web mode emits private OSC 7717 messages with the attached session and percent-encoded repository display name before the child starts, then clears both values whenever the list takes over; Terminal mode emits no browser wire. The browser mirrors the target in `?room=` and titles the tab `<repo> · RimZ`, while the list uses plain `RimZ`. Reconnect and refresh continuity follow the current view, stale targets clear when the list opens, and every detach returns to the list. Agent counts, attention, and the configured headline spend window read through `PublishedSnapshotReader`, keeping one incremental consumer cursor per live session and degrading an unreadable snapshot to an unenriched card. Non-terminal stdio prints the same live-session listing and exits 1.

The `n` overlay joins the same mux probe to dormant workspace records and adds a non-hidden directory listing rooted at `$HOME`. Confirming a path releases terminal raw mode, calls the neutral detached room-birth entry, and attaches the resulting live session as a child; browser preflight remains exclusive to explicit web room preparation, so the shared picker can create a terminal room without requiring ttyd. Birth errors restore the picker with a notice.

The ttyd binary resolves from `RIMZ_TTYD_BIN`, then `PATH`, and `ttyd --version` must parse at or above the single `MIN_TTYD_VERSION` floor of 1.7.5 before either daemon starts or is reused. A missing binary reports the Homebrew and apt install fix; an older or malformed version reports the required floor and upgrade path. `interface` must parse as an IP address, each trusted proxy must parse as an IP or CIDR, `auth_users` requires a non-empty `auth_header`, and every user must remain non-empty after trimming. These config preconditions fail before process changes with a typed error that names the fix, and an occupied configured listener returns a typed error that points to `[web] port`.

RimZ spawns ttyd and the optional gate with null stdio and their own process groups, then writes `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd.json` with `pid`, `port`, `interface`, `auth`, `auth_users`, `trusted_proxies`, `image_paste`, `basic_upstream`, `launch_context_scrubbed`, optional `gate: {pid, upstream_port, tunnel_port}`, optional `pixel_protocol`, and optional `index_key`. `basic_upstream` proves that ttyd uses the layered Basic-auth contract, `image_paste` and `gate.tunnel_port` prove both upload paths exist, `launch_context_scrubbed` proves that the daemon dropped its launch-pane identity, `pixel_protocol` is present only when the live daemon serves a generated page with RimZ's current pixel compatibility layer, and `index_key` carries that generated page's cache key. Records written before either marker deserialize the missing marker as false and are replaced before reuse; records without `auth_users` default to an empty allowlist, while records without `index_key` restart once when the desired profile has a generated page. The record is live only while ttyd is the recorded process, the optional gate is a recorded `rimz web gate` process, and the configured listener accepts a connection; readers remove stale records.

Both machine-wide ttyd processes discard the launch pane's mux membership, room/worktree and agent identity, client size, and remote-attach context before spawning. They continue to inherit machine runtime and configuration environment such as `HOME`, `XDG_*`, `PATH`, locale, observability, and RimZ binary or operational overrides such as `RIMZ_RTK`.

The desired listener, auth mode, user allowlist, proxy list, image-paste mode, gate and tunnel-listener presence, Basic-upstream marker, launch-context marker, and generated-index key participate in daemon reuse. Any drift stops the old processes and starts the desired shape, so an upgrade, font change, or ttyd version that changes the generated page replaces the daemon at the next ensure; every mode requires the credential file before reuse.

State transitions hold `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd.lock`, so concurrent room starts converge on one process and credential rotation cannot race stale-record cleanup.

The first shared-daemon start after an upgrade consumes the old `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd/` per-session records. RimZ sends SIGTERM only when a recorded pid still names `ttyd`, then removes the legacy directory; malformed records, recycled pids, and cleanup errors are debug diagnostics and do not block the new daemon.

`rimz web restart` performs the same stop under the daemon lock when a daemon is online and always starts a fresh process with the current binary and browser profile. `rimz web stop` sends SIGTERM to the gate and ttyd, waits one second while refreshing the process table, uses SIGKILL for a survivor, waits for the public listener to close, and removes the record.

## Broadcast daemon

The read-only surface uses a second ttyd process with structurally separate argv:

```text
ttyd -O -a -P 3600 -i <interface> -p <share_port> [-t <client-option>...] [-I <custom-index>] <current-rimz-exe> web exec --share
```

The missing `-W` makes ttyd 1.7 and later drop client input, and the missing `-c` makes the viewer URL unauthenticated. `auth_header`, `auth_users`, `trusted_proxies`, the authorization gate, credentials, image paste, and remote `--web` forwarding apply only to the writable daemon. The broadcast process receives the same theme, font, reconnect fixes, and pixel-compatible custom index with the upload bootstrap omitted.

`$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-share.json` stores `{ "sessions": [...] }` through temp-file plus rename. `share` validates a durable workspace record and live mux session before adding one sorted session and ensuring the daemon. The hidden share shim re-reads the file for every connection, repeats the record and liveness checks, and returns the single `this room is not shared` error for missing, unknown, unshared, and dead targets without listing other rooms.

A valid tmux broadcast execs `tmux -S <managed-socket> attach -t <session> -r -f ignore-size` when the probed tmux supports client flags; `-r` blocks mux input as defense in depth and `ignore-size` excludes the viewer from window sizing. A valid Zellij broadcast execs the ordinary `zellij attach <session>` because Zellij has no read-only attach; ttyd remains the input boundary, and viewer geometry can influence the session.

The daemon record at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd-share.json` carries `pid`, `port`, `interface`, `launch_context_scrubbed`, optional `pixel_protocol`, and optional `index_key`; `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd-share.lock` serializes allowlist and process transitions. A record is live only while its pid names ttyd and the listener accepts a connection. Records without the launch-context marker are replaced once on the next ensure; listener or generated-index drift also replaces the process before reuse. Both writable and broadcast records participate in the tmux pixel-client ancestry check.

Removing one session rewrites the allowlist and restarts the daemon so every existing viewer disconnects; still-shared browser tabs can reconnect through ttyd. Removing the final session or using `unshare --all` stops the process. `web stop` stops both daemons but retains the allowlist, `web restart` restarts the broadcast daemon when that list is non-empty, and `rimz reload` replaces each browser daemon only when it is online.

## Credential and browser client

The one credential named `rimz` lives at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd-credential.json`, mode 0600, with `name`, `created_at`, and `secret`. ttyd requires it in every auth mode, and a trusted-header gate reads the file at startup to precompute the injected Basic authorization value; the secret stays off gate argv.

Rotation stops and restarts the live writable daemon so the old secret stops working immediately. Revocation stops that daemon and removes the credential. ttyd read-only mode is process-wide, so RimZ rejects read-only credential creation and directs users to the separate broadcast process.

Credential creation, rotation, listing, and revocation have the same behavior in Basic and trusted-header modes. Rotation restarts both ttyd and its gate, so the gate's startup read receives the new secret.

The daemon always passes `macOptionIsMeta=true`, `cursorBlink=false`, `titleFixed=RimZ`, and `disableLeaveAlert=true`. With `style_client = true`, it also projects the shared theme into xterm.js options and resolves the configured font.

The built-in Nerd Font families use SHA-256-pinned regular and bold faces. HTTPS custom sources use a URL-hashed cache entry, local sources are read directly, and supported files end in `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, or `.woff2`. Font bytes live under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rimz/web-fonts`; `RIMZ_WEB_FONTS_OFFLINE` makes resolution cache-only.

ttyd serves no additional static route, so RimZ caches a generated index under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rimz/web-ttyd`. A cache miss starts a throwaway loopback ttyd on an ephemeral port, fetches its stock `/` page with temporary Basic Auth, stops it, and injects the font faces plus the compatibility bootstrap.

The bootstrap targets the xterm.js API bundled by ttyd 1.7.5 and newer, maps the browser's `room` query to ttyd's WebSocket `arg`, refreshes xterm after fonts load, keeps the cursor steady across reconnects and app-emitted blink sequences while preserving requested cursor shapes, preserves Shift+Enter and macOS Meta chords, bridges OSC 52 and browser selections to the clipboard, uploads pasted images when enabled, keeps the browser URL, reconnect target, and repository-first tab title on the attached room through private OSC 7717, restyles disconnect and resize overlays, proactively bounds mouse-motion reports while preserving their latest coordinate, re-arms held drags across tmux mouse-mode churn, and installs a bounded Kitty graphics compatibility layer. It consumes the character-producing `keypress` after a handled Option chord and captures any fallback dead-key composition on xterm's root before the textarea handlers can forward the accent, pins xterm's cursor-blink option steady while native handling keeps requested cursor shapes, holds the last cursor cell as a short-lived overlay across application redraw hides, bounded at 300 milliseconds, and suppresses xterm's wheel-to-cursor fallback only while the alternate screen has no active mouse protocol. A font or index failure warns and falls back without blocking the daemon.

The generated page marks each U+10EEEE plus Kitty row/column combining-mark cluster invisible as it enters xterm, then restores visibility before following text. Xterm still retains the complete placeholder cluster and RGB image id in its buffer, while its WebGL renderer paints the cell's real background instead of a carrier-colored fallback glyph. The pixel layer consumes RimZ's transmit, virtual-placement, and delete subset before xterm parses it, retains at most 128 decoded PNGs by image id, and draws each image through a clip path made only from its placeholder cells on a DPR-scaled overlay canvas. Render, scroll, and geometry events coalesce into one animation-frame scan; each scan skips rows without a placeholder before reading the matching cells' row and column marks plus RGB image id, then leaves the canvas untouched when that visible scene matches the painted scene. A placeholder move, image or placement revision, resize, reconnect, partial diff, or tmux client switch invalidates the scene and replaces the frame, preserving image aspect and logical origin while keeping paint inside the visible placement.

The tmux capability probe accepts an `xterm-256color` rendering client when its pid ancestry reaches the live ttyd pid recorded with the current `pixel_protocol`. The generated bootstrap participates in the cache key, so a browser-script or profile-schema change generates a fresh cached page; the daemon's matching `index_key` replaces either browser daemon at the next ensure when that page generation changes. Stock-page fallback omits both fields and stays sextant-capable only. A browser tab kept open across a RimZ upgrade can retain the previous page generation against the replacement daemon; reload the page to converge it.

## Commands and room start

`rimz web open` resolves or births the room, confirms the session is addressable, ensures the shared daemon, and returns its URL, auth mode, credential, and tunnel target. `--no-start` requires an already-live daemon.

`rimz web url` reads the room identity, existing credential, and live daemon state without changing the daemon or credential. It uses the live port when the daemon runs and the configured port otherwise; its v2 JSON omits `credential` when none exists. `share` and `unshare` own the broadcast allowlist; `restart`, `status`, and `stop` cover both daemon records. `rimz reload` restarts each daemon when it is online so a newly installed build supplies its current browser client; an offline daemon stays offline, and a restart failure warns without failing reload.

After a normal `rimz start` makes the room ready, `[web] enabled = true` asks RimZ to ensure the daemon. This path is deliberately best-effort: missing or pre-1.7.5 ttyd, a port collision, or a start failure prints a warning and never refuses the room. Explicit web commands enforce the same version floor as a fatal precondition.

## Configuration

`[web]` carries `enabled`, `interface`, `port`, `share_port`, `base_url`, `share_base_url`, `auth_header`, `auth_users`, `trusted_proxies`, `font`, `font_source`, `style_client`, and `image_paste`.

`enabled` and `image_paste` default to true, `interface` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, `port` defaults to 8200, and `share_port` defaults to 8201. Absent base URLs resolve to `http://127.0.0.1:<respective-port>`; a reverse proxy can set either public prefix, and RimZ appends `/?room=<session>`.

A non-empty trimmed `auth_header` selects trusted-header auth and always enables the gate, while an empty or absent value selects direct Basic Auth unless `trusted_proxies` enables the gate. `auth_users` defaults empty and permits any single non-empty identity; a non-empty list requires trusted-header mode and matches the request's trimmed identity byte-for-byte against entries trimmed during spec construction. `trusted_proxies` is empty by default. Trusted-header auth on a non-loopback interface with an empty proxy allowlist warns that only loopback proxies can connect and names the CIDR fix for a proxy on another host.

The section is per-machine and stays outside the trust hash because no field executes a command. `font_source` is a read-only local path or HTTPS URL.

## Remote rooms

Remote prep is one non-PTY `rimz web open --print --json` call. Its additive `rimz.web.v2` payload includes `auth: {mode: "basic"}` or `auth: {mode: "trusted_header", header: "<name>"}`, `credential: {username, secret}`, and `tunnel_port`. Missing `auth` defaults to Basic and missing `tunnel_port` falls back to `port` for older v2 peers.

The local side checks the exact schema and binds an in-process relay on the user-facing loopback port. SSH forwards a second ephemeral loopback port to `127.0.0.1:<tunnel_port>`; the relay strips any browser `Authorization` header and injects the returned Basic credential on every request before sending it to that forward. An image-paste daemon targets the gate's dedicated loopback listener so terminal HTTP, WebSocket upgrades, and uploads share one origin without weakening the public gate's trusted-header decision. A gated daemon without image paste still targets ttyd's loopback Basic-authenticated upstream, and a direct daemon uses the public `port`. This injection supports Safari, whose WebKit client omits cached Basic credentials from WebSocket upgrades even though ttyd authenticates the upgrade itself. There is no browser prompt or second token-provisioning SSH call. A legacy trusted-header payload without a credential still fails before tunnel setup and directs the user to its reverse-proxy URL.

The relay port derives from the session in 8300–8399 and scans on collision while retaining its listener to close the selection race. It stays bound across recovery rounds. Recovery repeats prep so it can rebirth the room, restart the daemon, discover a changed port or credential, open a fresh ephemeral SSH forward, and atomically retarget the relay while keeping the local URL stable. Version skew uses the existing remote-upgrade diagnostic; v1 payloads are not accepted.

## Security

The default listener binds to loopback and requires Basic Auth.

The gate treats a configured auth header as proof of the public proxy's authentication only after the peer address passes the loopback-or-allowlist check. It strips client authorization and presents the machine credential to ttyd itself, so ttyd never trusts a public identity header.

The source gate always admits loopback, but trusted-header authorization still requires the configured header there; loopback carries no header-auth bypass. The private ttyd upstream remains protected by Basic Auth. The client-side remote tunnel relay accepts unauthenticated requests on loopback and presents the remote machine credential upstream, matching the local-user trust boundary of a raw `ssh -L`; use host-level user isolation when another local user can connect as the tunnel-owning user or execute as that user.

Credentials stay out of URLs, logs, store events, and workspace records. The v2 credential appears in explicit JSON output that reports a saved credential and in local credential-management output; the remote tunnel keeps it in process memory for relay injection and omits it from stderr.

The broadcast listener intentionally has no RimZ authentication and prints a visible warning whenever an active share binds a non-loopback interface. Its allowlist limits rooms rather than viewers; anyone who can reach the listener can read the terminal output of every allowlisted room. Public deployments put HTTPS, optional viewer authentication, and network filtering in front of `share_port`.

The browser session is shell access as the serving user. A reverse proxy that exposes the listener provides HTTPS and rate limiting.
