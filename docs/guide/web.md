# Web

A terminal attach works well while you have the right terminal open. When you need the same room from a browser, RimZ can put its existing Zellij or tmux session behind one local ttyd address without moving the room, agents, or state into another service.

<p align="center">

  <br/><sub>The same room, in a browser tab: sidebar, agent panes, theme, and pixel rendering all carry over.</sub>
</p>

## Install ttyd on the serving machine

Both Zellij and tmux browser rooms require [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) 1.7.5 or newer:

```sh
brew install ttyd        # macOS or Linuxbrew
apt install ttyd         # when the configured repository provides 1.7.5+
ttyd --version
```

Run `brew upgrade ttyd` when Homebrew has an older build. On Debian or Ubuntu, check the apt candidate before installing and use a current repository or the ttyd release page when the distribution package is below 1.7.5. `rimz doctor` reports the resolved ttyd path and version. An explicit web command refuses a missing or older binary with this upgrade fix; a normal `rimz start` still opens the terminal room and prints the warning because browser startup is best-effort.

## Serve a local room

```sh
rimz web            # ensure the room and shared daemon, print URL + credential, open browser
rimz web url        # print an existing room's URL without requiring the daemon
rimz web share      # share one live room as a read-only broadcast
rimz web unshare    # revoke one room's broadcast
rimz web start      # start the machine-wide daemon without targeting a room
rimz web restart    # restart active browser daemons with current config
rimz web status     # report writable and broadcast listeners
rimz web stop       # stop both browser daemons
```

`rimz web` is `rimz web open`.

RimZ resolves or births the room first, confirms that its mux session is live, and ensures one ttyd daemon bound to `127.0.0.1:8200` by default. Every Zellij and tmux room on the machine shares that process.

The printed route is `http://127.0.0.1:8200/?room=<session>`. ttyd passes the selected session to a hidden RimZ shim, which accepts only a live session backed by a RimZ workspace record and attaches with the correct mux command. Changing the URL argument cannot run an arbitrary command. Links from older releases that use `?arg=` still attach to the same exact session.

The browser shows a Basic-Auth prompt. Use the printed user `rimz` and password. Add `--no-start` when a supervisor owns ttyd and the command should fail rather than start it.

Safari can load this direct local page but cannot attach the terminal because WebKit omits Basic credentials from WebSocket upgrades. Use `rimz remote connect --web`, put a trusted-header reverse proxy in front, or open the direct local URL in Chrome. The remote tunnel injects the credential locally and supports Safari without changing the always-on daemon topology.

With `[web] enabled = true`, every normal `rimz start` also asks for the shared daemon after the room is ready. A missing or pre-1.7.5 binary, occupied port, or daemon error warns on stderr and leaves the room usable in the terminal.

## Session manager

Open the base address without `?room=` to choose among every live RimZ room on the machine. An unknown or stopped session argument opens the same switcher with a notice; a valid argument continues to attach directly. The browser reuses the same picker as the first-class [`rimz sessions`](../reference/cli/getting-started.md#pick-a-session) terminal command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../rimz-sessions.png" alt="The session manager: a RIMZ banner over a bordered sessions box, one card per live room with repository name, path, provider agent counts, session count, tokens, and spend" width="720">
  <br/><sub>Every live room as a card: provider agent counts on the left, sessions, tokens, and spend on the right.</sub>
</p>

The switcher centers its room cards in a fixed 24-row panel beneath a RIMZ banner when the terminal has space, using 40% of the terminal width within its 58- to 84-column bounds. Empty rows keep the box stable when only a few rooms are live; small screens fall back to a compact full-frame list. Rooms with prompt activity in the last 24 hours lead, newest prompt first; the rest follow by the most recent room start or attach.

Use ↑/↓ or j/k and the mouse wheel to move, Enter or a second click on the selected card to attach, and printable keys to filter repository names and paths. Backspace edits the filter, Esc clears it before quitting, and Ctrl-C quits immediately. Press `n` to choose a dormant workspace or browse from `$HOME`; Enter births and attaches its room, while arrows and Tab navigate directories.

Each two-line card leads with the repository name and path, then shows live root-agent counts by provider. The red `●` count marks agents that need attention; `◎`, `◇`, and `$` show the headline session count, tokens, and spend from `[sidebar] spend_window`. An unreadable room snapshot leaves the stats line at `–` until the next probe.

After attachment, the browser address gains that room's `?room=` target and the tab reads `<repo> · RimZ`; the live-session list uses plain `RimZ`. A dropped connection or page refresh reconnects directly into the same room; leaving through the mux detach key clears the target and title, returns to the live session list, and makes that list the reconnect destination again.

## Share a read-only broadcast

```sh
rimz web share [PATH] --print
rimz web share --session rimz-project-a1b2c3 --json
rimz web unshare [PATH]
rimz web unshare --session rimz-project-a1b2c3
rimz web unshare --all
```

`share` requires an already-live RimZ room, adds only that room to a durable allowlist, starts a second ttyd daemon on `127.0.0.1:8201` by default, and prints its viewer URL. The viewer daemon has no Basic-Auth prompt and drops all browser input; it cannot reach another live room by changing `?room=` because its shim accepts only allowlisted sessions and gives the same generic refusal for unknown, stopped, and unshared names.

The viewer link is deliberately unauthenticated. Keep the listener on loopback for local viewing, or put HTTPS and any desired viewer authentication in a reverse proxy before exposing it. Set `share_base_url` to the proxy's public prefix; `auth_header`, `auth_users`, and `trusted_proxies` govern only the writable listener. A shared room on a non-loopback `interface` prints a warning that anyone who can reach `share_port` can watch.

`unshare` restarts the broadcast daemon while other rooms remain shared, which disconnects every existing viewer and lets still-shared tabs reconnect. Removing the last room or using `--all` stops the daemon. The allowlist survives `rimz web stop`; `rimz web status` shows both its retained sessions and whether the broadcast daemon is online.

tmux viewers attach read-only and with `ignore-size`, so they cannot type or resize the presenter's layout. Zellij has no read-only or size-isolated attach mode: ttyd still blocks viewer input, but a viewer window resize can influence the shared Zellij session geometry.

## Browser appearance and input

Paste a screenshot or bitmap while a writable browser room has focus and RimZ uploads it to the serving machine's private temporary directory, then inserts the shell-quoted absolute path at the cursor. It does not submit the prompt. PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF are accepted up to 20 MiB; file signatures decide the format, so an SVG or a mislabeled payload is rejected. Files are mode `0600` inside a per-user mode `0700` directory and expire after 24 hours. On Linux with the default temporary root, a returned path looks like `/tmp/rimz-web-images-1000/<uuid>.png`.

Image paste is on by default for the authenticated writable listener. Set `rimz config set web.image_paste false`, then run `rimz web restart`, to keep ordinary text paste while disabling the upload route. Read-only broadcasts never install the image-paste client or accept uploads.

RimZ gives ttyd the active theme and configured browser font when the daemon starts. `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono` and `CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono` are built-in presets: RimZ downloads verified regular and bold faces and caches them under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rimz/web-fonts`.

Set `font_source` to a local `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, or `.woff2` file, or to an HTTPS URL. A family with no preset and no source asks the browser to resolve an installed font. `style_client = false` keeps ttyd's browser colors while retaining keyboard, cursor, clipboard, and reconnect fixes.

The compatibility layer keeps the cursor steady when terminal apps request blinking while preserving their requested cursor shapes, preserves Shift+Enter and macOS Option-as-Meta input, keeps residual wheel motion from becoming arrow keys during attach transitions, keeps tmux drag selection and pane-border resize responsive by bounding motion-driven repaint pressure and repairing held drags across tmux mouse-mode changes, sends tmux copy-mode yanks and Shift-drag selections to the clipboard, refreshes xterm after a downloaded font loads, and renders pixel pets plus the pixel context meter in qualifying tmux rooms. Missing font bytes warn and fall back to monospace. Zellij rooms, tmux below 3.6, disabled passthrough, a stock-page fallback, or any attached plain terminal use sextant cell art instead.

A browser tab kept open while RimZ upgrades can retain the previous compatibility page until it reloads. Reload that tab after an upgrade to converge it with the new shared daemon.

Appearance is fixed when the shared daemon starts. After changing `[theme]` or web styling, run:

```sh
rimz web restart
```

## Behind a reverse proxy

A reverse proxy can terminate HTTPS and let an Authentik forward-auth decision identify the user while ttyd keeps its machine-wide Basic Auth behind that public edge. Set Authentik's Traefik forward-auth middleware to return `X-Authentik-Username` in its auth response headers, attach that middleware to the router serving RimZ, and make the proxy overwrite or remove any client-supplied copy of that header before forwarding.

Set the proxy's idle read timeout above ttyd's one-hour ping interval so a genuinely idle browser tab remains attached. For nginx, set `proxy_read_timeout` above 3600 seconds. Cloudflare's 100-second timeout is not configurable on lower plans, so idle tabs behind those plans periodically reattach.

Bind an Authentik access policy to the RimZ application as the primary control over who reaches the proxy. RimZ's `auth_users` allowlist adds defense in depth at the writable terminal itself; list each allowed identity with the exact canonical username spelling Authentik emits.

Point RimZ at the public URL and name the header the proxy injects:

```toml
[web]
base_url = "https://shell.example.com/rimz"
auth_header = "X-Authentik-Username"
auth_users = ["alice"]
```

When Traefik runs on the same host and reaches the host through a Docker bridge, expose the listener and admit only that bridge CIDR:

```toml
[web]
base_url = "https://shell.example.com/rimz"
auth_header = "X-Authentik-Username"
auth_users = ["alice"]
interface = "0.0.0.0"
trusted_proxies = ["172.18.0.0/16"]
```

RimZ starts Basic-authenticated ttyd on an ephemeral loopback port and a small authorization gate on `0.0.0.0:8200`. The gate accepts only loopback or configured source CIDRs, requires exactly one non-empty `X-Authentik-Username` on every HTTP request, matches its trimmed value byte-for-byte and case-sensitively against `auth_users`, strips client-supplied `Authorization`, and presents ttyd's Basic credential upstream. An empty or absent `auth_users` allows any single non-empty identity for compatibility. Use the proxy host's address or subnet for a proxy on another LAN or VPC host. Keep the host firewall restricted to the same sources; `trusted_proxies` sees the TCP peer address, so configure the CIDR for the address that actually reaches RimZ after container and host networking.

Restart after changing the auth or listener shape:

```sh
rimz web restart
```

The gate rejects missing, empty, duplicated, and non-allowlisted identity headers after validating the peer address. An empty `trusted_proxies` list accepts only a proxy connecting from loopback. The gate admits loopback as a source but still requires exactly one identity header there; the private ttyd listener separately requires Basic Auth.

The trusted-header decision applies only at the public gate. `rimz remote connect --web` injects the machine credential inside its local relay and tunnels through SSH to a private loopback listener: the image-capable gate when image paste is enabled, or ttyd directly when it is disabled. Both Basic and trusted-header configurations therefore keep terminal and image traffic on the browser's one local origin without weakening the public proxy decision.

## Open a remote room

```sh
rimz remote connect dev --web
rimz remote connect dev --web --web-port 8443
```

RimZ uses one SSH prep call to birth or resume the remote room, ensure its shared daemon, and return the credential plus the private tunnel target. It opens an ephemeral SSH forward to the remote ttyd listener, then serves `http://127.0.0.1:<local-port>/?room=<session>` through a local relay that injects the credential into page and WebSocket requests. The browser receives no password prompt, and Safari works despite WebKit omitting Basic credentials from WebSocket upgrades. This path is uniform whether the remote public edge uses Basic or trusted-header auth.

The tunnel stays in the foreground and follows the normal remote recovery policy. Recovery repeats prep, so a stopped daemon comes back and a rotated credential reaches the relay; the local URL stays stable. Without `--web-port`, the local port derives from the session in 8300–8399 and scans forward when busy.

## Credentials

```sh
rimz web token create
rimz web token list
rimz web token revoke rimz
rimz web token revoke-all
```

One credential named `rimz` serves the whole machine in every auth mode. `create` rotates it and restarts the live daemon and gate. Either revoke command stops the daemon and clears the credential.

ttyd read-only mode belongs to the whole process, so `rimz web token create --read-only` points to the separate `rimz web share` broadcast instead of presenting a misleading per-user permission.

Treat the password like an SSH private key. It stays out of the URL, logs, events, and workspace records.

## Configuration

```toml
[web]
enabled = true
port = 8200
share_port = 8201
interface = "127.0.0.1"
# base_url = "https://devbox.example/rimz"
# share_base_url = "https://watch.example/rimz"
# auth_header = "X-Authentik-Username"
# auth_users = ["alice"]
# trusted_proxies = ["172.18.0.0/16"]
font = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono"
# font_source = "/path/to/font.woff2"
style_client = true
image_paste = true
```

`interface` selects the bind address for both daemons; `port` selects the writable listener and `share_port` selects the read-only broadcast listener. `base_url` and `share_base_url` change the respective prefixes RimZ prints when a reverse proxy fronts RimZ; the `/?room=<session>` query remains. `auth_header` puts a proxy-validated identity header at the writable authorization gate while ttyd retains Basic Auth, `auth_users` optionally restricts its exact canonical values, and non-empty `trusted_proxies` admits those source addresses to that gate. `image_paste` controls the authenticated temporary-file upload route described above.

## Security boundary

By default, RimZ invokes ttyd with write access, origin checks, mandatory Basic Auth, and an explicit loopback bind. The image-paste route requires that same Basic or trusted-header decision plus a custom same-origin request header that ordinary cross-site forms cannot send; it never exists on the unauthenticated broadcast listener.

The one machine credential authenticates the shared listener, so it grants access to every live RimZ room on that machine rather than only the room named in the first URL. An authenticated client can submit another session argument, and a missing or rejected argument opens the live-room session manager. A remote `--web` tunnel forwards this same machine-wide surface through an unauthenticated loopback relay on the client machine, matching the local-user trust boundary of `ssh -L`; use host-level user isolation on a shared client machine.

The broadcast listener is a separate process without `-W` or `-c`: ttyd drops input and admits connections without authentication, while RimZ's per-connection shim limits attachment to the durable room allowlist and never lists other rooms. Its output can still contain secrets. Bind it to loopback or place it behind a reverse proxy and firewall before public exposure.

The browser session is shell access as the serving user, and terminal output can contain secrets. Treat either the credential or trusted-header boundary as machine-wide shell access. Put HTTPS and rate limiting in front before exposing the listener beyond loopback:

```text
browser -> HTTPS authenticating proxy -> authorization gate -> Basic-authenticated loopback ttyd
```
